This mouse-move2 python script will type '1' in every 120 second to an opened notepad or wordpad (on top of your screen).
I used this to prevent the windows screen saver pop up while downloading or uploading big files due to my company windows 
policy which does not allow users disabling the screen saver
I also tried another method to move the mouse back and fore by 1 pix (comment out) but could not stop the Windows screen saver.
