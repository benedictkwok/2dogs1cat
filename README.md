This mouse-move2 python script will type '1' in every 120 second to an opened notepad or wordpad (on top of your screen).
I used this to prevent the windows screen saver pop up when downloading or uploading big image files.
I tried to move the mouse back and fore 1 pix (comment out) but could not stop the Windows screen saver.
